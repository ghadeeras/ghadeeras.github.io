                    A tree is a classic example on fractals or models that could be constructed
                    in a recursive way. This instance of that classic example comes with a twist
                    though (literally).
                </p><p>
                    One of the transformations you could apply on the tree model here is to 
                    twist it. The challenge with twists is that they are non-linear 
                    trasnformations that could not be represented by a matrix applied 
                    uniformally on all vertecies of the model. A twist matrix is calculated 
                    for each vertex position in the vertex shader, as well as another twist 
                    matrix for each vertext normal to obtain realisting shading.
