                    This toy is meant to experiment with the idea of using the marching cubes algorithm / scalar field 
                    tessellation (see <a href="/pages/scalar-field.html">this other toy</a>) as means towards creating a simple 
                    sculpting tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea is to start from a simple scalar field (such as <i>f<sub>base</sub>(x, y, z) = x<sup>2</sup> + 
                    y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup></i>) which when tessellated for some contour value <i>v</i> would give a base 
                    geometric shape, like a sphere. This can be thought of as the base "stone" from which the sculpture would 
                    be carved or modelled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The act of carving/modelling is done by adding/subtracting another scalar field <i>c(x, y, z)</i>, 
                    representing the shape of the sculpting tool, to the current field around the point where the action is 
                    performed. The magnitude of carving/modelling is determined by how much the user drags the pointer 
                    vertically (height/depth) and horizontally (breadth). The change will be aligned with the surface normal 
                    at the action point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the simplest case, if we do carve at a surface point <i>p<sub>c</sub> = (x<sub>c</sub>, y<sub>c</sub>, 
                    z<sub>c</sub>)</i>, the new scalar field would be:
                </p>
                <p><i>
                    f<sub>after</sub>(x, y, z) = <br /><span style="margin-left: 32px;">f<sub>before</sub>(x, y, z) -</span> 
                    <br /><span style="margin-left: 32px;">c(x / m - x<sub>c</sub>, y / m - y<sub>c</sub>, z / m - z<sub>c</sub>)</span>
                </i></p>
                <p>
                    where <i>m</i> is a value representing the magnitude of the carving. In a more general case, <i>x / m, 
                    y / m, z / m</i> would be replaced by some values <i>x<sub>m</sub>, y<sub>m</sub>, z<sub>m</sub></i> such 
                    that:
                </p>
                <p><i>
                    [x<sub>m</sub>, y<sub>m</sub>, z<sub>m</sub>] = [x, y, z] M <sup>-1</sup>
                </i></p>
                <p>
                    where <i>M</i> is a matrix that scales and orients the carving tool, and is a function of the desired
                    height/depth, breadth, and the normal at the surface point.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few interesting challenges were encountered in this experiment. For example, the scalar field of the
                    sculpting tool should be sampled at different resolutions, while applying appropriate filtering at each 
                    resolution to avoid aliasing. Lower resolutions of the carving tool are used when the magnitude of the 
                    carving is small. Another challenge is how to deform the scalar field of the carving tool depending on 
                    the desired height/depth and breadth, which could be controlled independently, while keeping the 
                    deformation perpendicular on the sculpture surface.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    The end result is fun to play with, but I think it suffers from a few drawbacks that limit its 
                    practicality. For instance, the use of the marching cubes algorithm means one has only a limited space to 
                    work in. Once one grows the sculpture beyond that limit, its surface appears to rupture. In addition, it is 
                    at times hard to predict how the surface will change. That is because there is no visual cues about the 
                    scalar field value outside the surface of the sculpture. So, modelling the sculpture at some places could 
                    cause some surfaces to appear unexpectedly in surrounding spaces.
